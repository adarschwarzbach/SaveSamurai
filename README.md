## :warning: The Problem

According to a study by [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/emergency-savings-report/#no-emergency-savings):
- **22%** of Americans have no emergency savings.
- **30%** have less than 3 months of savings.
- **18%** have 3-5 months of savings.

In total, this means a staggering **70%** of Americans have less than 5 months of emergency savings. A key issue contributing to this concerning statistic is a potential lack of understanding of spending habits. Many Americans might not be aware of where their money goes monthly, or how they can optimize their spending to save more without compromising their quality of life.
